# Automate_PastPerfect
This repository is a project that automates the process of inserting large amounts of data provided by an 
excel sheet into the Marist College Archives and Special Collections database inside the application: PastPerfect.

I was initially tasked with inserting this data manually and took it upon myself to work on this bot
to improve the archives. A task that could have taken me numerous months
could now be completed on the side, while employees who are also tasked with inserting this data manually can accommodate other tasks.

The imports I mainly used were 'openpyxl' and 'selenium.'
- Openpyxl is a python library that reads from an Excel file or writes to an Excel file.
- Selenium is an open-source umbrella project for various tools and libraries that support browser automation. 
  It provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests across most modern web browsers without the need to learn a test scripting language.
